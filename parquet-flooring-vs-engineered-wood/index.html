Which is Best? Vinyl Plank or Engineered Hardwood From flooringsuperstores.com

Any wood floor will be somewhat more soft and warm underfoot than hard flooring materials, such as ceramic or stone tile, but it will feel colder and harder than carpet, cork, or luxury vinyl. If your parquet floors are made of engineered wood, the stakes are that much higher because engineered wood can only be refinished so many times before it needs to be replaced.

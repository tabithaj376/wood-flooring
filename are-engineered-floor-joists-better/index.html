<p>Our products are popular with house builders, commercial property developers, architects, and engineers for all construction projects. Floor joists can help in managing the load and stress of not only the exterior of buildings and structures but also of the interior aspects. Yes, there are some disadvantages of engineered hardwood, even though still one of our favorite types of wood flooring. They are also very versatile and can have larger holes than a 2×10.</p>

<p>Engineered wood is more sustainable, using less trees and costs less to use per square foot. Engineered wood products have pushed the design boundaries to lengths that seemed unachievable a few short years ago. Because of their i cross sectional shape, engineered wood joists weigh up to 60 percent less than lumber joists, making engineered wood components easier to handle.

With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks. A floating floor will expand and contract with humidity changes which helps it to avoid the buckling that can occur as glued and nailed down floors age. Hence, soundproofing nailed down floors is unavoidable. Before you nail down hardwood, flooring must be stored in a controlled environment within the above mentioned temperature and humidity.

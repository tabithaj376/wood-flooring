Fixing an automatic garage door that keeps getting stuck From youtube.com
What to do if your garage door keeps closing &amp; reopening. I�m going to set up a camera in the garage for a few days to monitor if it still opens when i�m not here. There is no keypad so it�s not that, so it would have to be an rf remote, the button inside the garage, or myq. Another easy way to fix a garage door that opens by itself is by checking the remote opener.

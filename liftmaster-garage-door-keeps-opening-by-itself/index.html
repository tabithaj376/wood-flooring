<p>When a garage door descends on command but then immediately reverses itself, the problem is usually with the sensor eyes along the side tracks or with the door�s wheels binding in their tracks. If the safety sensors and operator button are working correctly, and no bad wiring or connections are found, your issue may be with the control board in the garage door opener itself.

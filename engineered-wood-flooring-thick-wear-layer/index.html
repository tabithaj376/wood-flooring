Hurst Hardwoods Red Oak Prefinished Engineered Wood From houzz.com
Engineered wood flooring are a type of hardwood flooring constructed from a three layer core of wood together with plywood and a top layer of hardwood veneer. The 4mm wear layer is able to be sanded and refinished several times over its lifespan. The thicknesses range from 13mm to 22mm depending upon the size of wear layer (top layer of solid wood) and how many base layers the plank has. The first of these figures tells you the overall thickness of the flooring board and the second tells you the thickness of the top layer or lamella, which is made of solid oak (you’ll see other species, but oak is the most.

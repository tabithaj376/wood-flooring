What Wood Flooring is Suitable for Underfloor Heating From allaboutmaterials.com
The thermal resistance measurements regarding underfloor heating systems with a screed when using engineered wood flooring are below. The final thickness will vary dependant on specific factors. However, how efficiently you install underfloor heating will depend on the wooden flooring and the temperatures the floor heating system can reach. While there are no rules for the thickness of the wood you can use with underfloor heating, we recommend that wood thickness should be no more than 18mm as any thicker than this will hinder the efficient performance of the heating system.

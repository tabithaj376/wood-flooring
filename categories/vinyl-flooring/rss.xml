&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is manufactured—but all the components are natural and organic. The best way to avoid popping noise is most importantly by allowing the wood to acclimate to the house and always nail properly down to the subfloor as well as using the right sized fasteners. The result is a locking plank system with actual hardwood with less cost. Whether you choose solid hardwood flooring or engineered flooring, the durability of the finish is the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Wood floors are durable and easy to maintain, but they�re still subject to accidental gouges, scratches, and heavy wear. In my opinion i think the only option is to sand it all back to the bare wood, apply a coat of shellac barrier seal to lock in any nasties in the grain of the wood and then overcoat with a quality polyurethane floor varnish, or waterbased floor finish. It�s better to have to paint on extra coats that will actually dry, than to saturate the floor with a coat that doesn�t dry, which will lead to your polyurethane peeling again. The process involves removing the top layer of the covering material using a large sander, which removes the surface finish and digs down past any surface scratches, stains, or imperfections that might exist.</p>

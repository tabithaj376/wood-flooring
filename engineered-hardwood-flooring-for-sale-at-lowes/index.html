<p>Wood flooring often ranges between $3 and $15 per square foot (solid or engineered) for domestic wood species, while exotic hardwood species can cost more. It looks and feels just like a traditional wooden floor because the top layer is real solid hardwood, and it is perfect for use as paneling or even joinery projects like doors and tabletops as well as for floors. This type of construction makes engineered hardwood less likely to expand and better suitable for installation over radiant heating systems, concrete slabs and basements.

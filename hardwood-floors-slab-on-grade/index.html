<p>New concrete is heavy with moisture, so test for dryness before beginning the subfloor. A concrete slab on grade works well on relatively level sites with a first floor (or basement) level that will be relatively close to existing grade. Successful installation also requires conducting a concrete slab moisture test before parquet installation. Since humidity causes natural wood to expand and contract, your flooring won’t be able to move.</p>

Hampton Herringbone 14mm Parquet Engineered Flooring From discountflooringdepot.co.uk
In general, if you have oak hardwood flooring, and choose a match of both species and grade, simply by refinishing the wood and staining will provide you with the overall look you desire. When you need the exact material to repair a prominent area, try sourcing it from a different area of your house. We would recommend trying to clean away that top coat, so your floor matches the new planks rather than the other way around. Make things easier on yourself and pick a damaged tile that already needs to be replaced.

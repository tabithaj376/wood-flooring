<p>Expansion gaps are spaces left around the perimeter of rooms, against fixed objects such as columns, thresholds, hearths, baseboard, and other stationary items built or secured into the framing structure of the home. Instead of pushing filler out from the gap when your wood expands with heat, it flexibly adapts with your flooring. As a result, when it comes to installing engineered wood flooring you must leave an expansion gap, otherwise you could come up against severe problems in the future. The size and the severity of the gap, however, will depend on several factors.</p>

Koeber�s Installed Handscraped 5&#34; hardwood. Lovely rustic From pinterest.com
To prevent dog scratches on hardwood floors, go for brazilian cherry which has a janka rating of 2350 or brazilian walnut, with a rating of 3684 respectively. Engineered woods not only tend to be more durable and scratch resistant than regular hardwood, they are often designed to be slip resistant so your dog won’t be sliding around as it runs. That means dust, dirt, and pet hair are less likely to stick to it, making cleanup a breeze. You probably want to know which hardwood flooring is best for dogs, as that’s what’s in most homes.

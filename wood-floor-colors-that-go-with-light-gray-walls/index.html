This color not only helps to make the floor look brighter but also gives the room a natural and fresh impression. If you are considering light gray, a complete opposite to the dark gray, then instead of dark undertones, use light colors like cream, beige and lighter shades of brown. Avoid grey walls if your floors are also grey. The combination of a light gray floor and white walls will create a light and clean interior with a precise rhythm.
